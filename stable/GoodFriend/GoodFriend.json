  "Description": "Key Features:\n- Receive notifications when friends using GoodFriend log in or out.\n- Chat messages show how many of your friends are online when you log in.\n\nDeveloper's Note on Using This Plugin After Patch 7.0:\nAs of Patch 7.0, some of the data that GoodFriend uses to identify players during login/logout events is now visible to anyone nearby your character in-game (not just your friends or party members). GoodFriend itself will still only show notifications for people you've added to your in-game friends list - however, please use this plugin only if you're comfortable with your login/logout activity being theoretically visible to nearby players (note: GoodFriend never sends data for users who don't have the plugin installed).\n\nIf you ever want to stop sending login/logout events, simply disable or uninstall the plugin. The server does not store any data about you.\n\nFor added privacy, you can now set a 'group key' in the plugin settings. This allows events to be shared only with people using the same key (for example, everyone in your raid group). When a group key is active, your events are never visible to anyone outside your group no matter what.",
