  "Description": "A live bestiary.\nShows target mob aggro type, a subjective threat level, status vulnerabilities, and a general overview of notable mechanics.\nThreat level is meant to be taken with a grain of salt, is aimed towards solo players, and assumes a general familiarity with deep dungeon mechanics and the class being played.\nInformation is accurate to the best of my knowledge based on crowdsourced information, but I could use your help! Please open an issue on the GitHub if you'd like to correct inaccurate or untested data.\nOriginally DeepDungeonDex",
