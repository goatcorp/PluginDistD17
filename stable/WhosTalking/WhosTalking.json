You should get colourful outlines around the job icons on the party list: green for talking, blue for muted, red for deafened, and yellow for unknown name.\n\nNote that you'll get a permission prompt mentioning \"StreamKit Overlay\" – this is expected.\n\nIf stuff breaks, let me know - click Send Feedback (speech bubble icon) below this text.",
