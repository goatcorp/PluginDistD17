  "Description": "This plugin allows players to use an Elgato Stream Deck as a virtual utility hot bar. Actions are called directly, meaning there is no need to set up awkward keybinds, custom macros, or any other settings.\n\nNote that the XIVDeck Stream Deck plugin must also be installed for this plugin to be useful. You can download the Stream Deck plugin from the linked GitHub repository, under the \"Releases\" section.\n\nPlease report all problems to KazWolfe#2896 in the Dalamud Support server or by opening an Issue on GitHub.",
